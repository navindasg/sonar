# ObsidianRAG

A local MCP server that gives Claude Desktop semantic search and file access over Obsidian vaults. It indexes markdown notes into a FAISS vector store using locally-hosted embeddings via Ollama, watches for file changes in real time, and exposes MCP tools through the stdio transport. The entire system runs on your machine with zero cloud dependencies.

**Key features:**
- Semantic search over vault notes using FAISS and Ollama embeddings
- Heading-based chunking that preserves the semantic structure of Obsidian notes
- Optional LLM reranking via Ollama for more relevant results
- Wikilink context: follow forward links and discover backlinks from any note
- Multi-vault support with independent indexes per vault
- Real-time file watching with debounced incremental re-indexing
- Configurable tool surface — enable or disable individual tools via config
- Optional nightly daily-note formatting: a local LLM tags and cleans up raw daily notes while preserving the original text

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- An embedding model pulled: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- (Optional) A rerank model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
- (Optional, for daily-note formatting on Apple Silicon) A chat model: `ollama pull gemma4:26b-mlx` (MLX-optimized, served via Ollama — no separate MLX install; see [Model selection](#model-selection))

> **macOS ARM64 note:** `faiss-cpu` requires macOS 14+ for the ARM64 pip wheel. If you are on macOS 13 (Ventura) with Apple Silicon, install via conda instead:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu
> ```

---

## Installation

Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navindasg/ObsidianRagMCP.git
cd ObsidianRagMCP
pip install .
```

For development (editable install with dev dependencies):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# or, with uv (a uv.lock is checked in):
uv sync
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a config file

Create `~/.obsidian-rag/config.yaml` with the path to your vault:

```yaml
vaults:
  - name: my-vault
    path: ~/Documents/ObsidianVault
```

Alternatively, run `python -m obsidian_rag` once — when no config exists it
generates a commented default at `~/.obsidian-rag/config.yaml` and exits with
instructions to edit it.

### 2. Verify the server starts

```bash
python -m obsidian_rag
```

You should see startup messages on stderr confirming Ollama connectivity and index build progress. The server then waits for MCP requests on stdin.

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-rag": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "obsidian_rag"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The ObsidianRAG tools will be available in your conversations.

---

## Claude Desktop Integration

The Claude Desktop configuration file lives at:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following entry under `"mcpServers"`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-rag": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "obsidian_rag"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you installed into a virtual environment, use the full path to the Python executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-rag": {
      "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "obsidian_rag"]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Desktop will spawn the server as a subprocess and communicate via stdio. No network ports are opened.

---

## Configuration Reference

The default config file location is `~/.obsidian-rag/config.yaml`. A minimal config requires only the `vaults` section; all other sections have sensible defaults.

```yaml
vaults:
  - name: my-vault
    path: ~/Documents/ObsidianVault
    excluded_dirs: [".obsidian", ".trash", "templates"]
    excluded_patterns: []

  chunk_max_tokens: 512          # Max tokens per chunk
  chunk_overlap: 50              # Token overlap between consecutive chunks
  include_frontmatter: metadata_only  # "metadata_only", "embed", or "ignore"
  watch_enabled: true            # Watch for file changes and reindex automatically

  max_context_tokens: 4000       # Total token budget across all results

rerank:
  enabled: false                 # Set true to enable LLM reranking
  model: null                    # Reranking model (defaults to llama3.2 when enabled)
  top_n: 20                      # Candidates fetched from FAISS before reranking

tools:
  enabled:
    - search
    - read_note
    - list_notes
    - find_notes
    - note_context
    - vault_stats
    - reindex

daily_format:
  enabled: false                 # Master switch for the nightly formatting job
  daily_folder: ""               # Daily-notes folder relative to vault root ("" = vault root)
  filename_format: "%Y-%m-%d"    # strptime pattern matched against note filename stems
  model: null                    # Ollama chat model (null = auto-select from pulled models)

  schedule_minute: 30            # Minute of the nightly launchd run (0–59)
  max_retries: 3                 # Attempts per note before it is parked in the queue
  blacklist: []                  # Notes never formatted (stems or relative paths, .md optional)
  format_tag: "#!format"         # Marker that opts any note in to the next run (null disables)
  poll_minutes: 5                # Background tag-poll interval in minutes
  min_battery_percent: 20        # Defer runs on battery below this percent (0 disables)
```

### Section descriptions

| Section | Purpose | Notable defaults |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `vaults` | One or more vault definitions | `excluded_dirs` hides `.obsidian`, `.trash`, `templates` |
| `embedding` | Ollama embedding model settings | `nomic-embed-text` at `localhost:11434` |
| `indexing` | Chunking strategy and file watching | Heading-based chunking, watching enabled |
| `retrieval` | Search result count and quality thresholds | `top_k=5`, `similarity_threshold=0.7` |
| `rerank` | Optional LLM reranking pass | Disabled by default; requires `llama3.2` or similar |
| `tools` | Which MCP tools are exposed to Claude | All 7 tools enabled by default |
| `daily_format` | Nightly daily-note formatting job | Disabled by default; runs at 00:30 when installed |

---

## Multi-Vault Setup

Each vault in `config.vaults` gets its own independent index stored under `~/.obsidian-rag/<vault-name>/`.

```yaml
vaults:
  - name: personal
    path: ~/Documents/PersonalVault
    excluded_dirs: [".obsidian", ".trash"]

  - name: work
    path: ~/Documents/WorkVault
    excluded_dirs: [".obsidian", ".trash", "archive"]
```

When using the `search` tool without a `vault_name` argument, results are merged across all vaults and sorted by relevance score. Each result includes a `vault_name` field so Claude can identify provenance.

---

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Key Parameters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `search` | Semantic similarity search across vault notes | `query` (required), `vault_name`, `tags`, `folder` |
| `read_note` | Read the full content of a single note | `path` (required), `vault_name` |
| `list_notes` | List markdown files in a vault with metadata | `path_prefix`, `vault_name` |
| `find_notes` | Keyword/filename search (case-insensitive) | `query` (required), `vault_name` |
| `note_context` | Note content plus wikilink forward/back links | `path` (required), `vault_name` |
| `vault_stats` | Index health: note count, chunk count, index age | (none) |
| `reindex` | Trigger background rebuild of a vault's index | `vault_name` (required) |

### Tool return formats

**`search`** returns `{"results": [...]}` where each result has `source_path`, `heading_path`, `relevance_score` (0.0–1.0), `snippet`, and `vault_name`.

**`read_note`** returns `{"path": "...", "content": "...", "frontmatter": {...}}` on success, or `{"error": "...", "suggestion": "..."}` on failure. Only `.md` files inside the vault (and outside `excluded_dirs`) are accessible; the same applies to `note_context`.

**`list_notes`** returns `{"notes": [...]}` where each entry has `path`, `size`, `modified` (ISO 8601), and `tag_count`.

**`find_notes`** returns `{"results": [...]}` where each entry has `file` and `heading_path`.

**`note_context`** returns `{"note": {path, content}, "forward_links": [{path, exists}], "backlinks": [{source_path, heading_path, snippet}]}`.

**`vault_stats`** returns `{"vaults": [...], "total_notes": N, "total_chunks": N}` where each vault entry includes `vault`, `note_count`, `chunk_count`, `index_age`, `embedding_model`, and `last_reindex` (the outcome of the most recent background reindex, or `null`).

**`reindex`** returns `{"status": "started" | "already_running", "vault": "...", "message": "..."}` immediately without blocking. Check `vault_stats.last_reindex` for the outcome.

---

## Daily Note Formatting

An optional nightly job that cleans up raw Obsidian daily notes (files whose stem matches `daily_format.filename_format`, e.g. `2026-06-11.md`, in the vault root or a configured `daily_folder`). A local Ollama chat model suggests tags and a reorganized markdown body; the model is told to prefer tags from your vault's existing tag vocabulary and to invent a new lowercase-kebab-case tag only when nothing fits. Code — not the model — assembles the final file:

1. YAML frontmatter: merged `tags`, the note's `date`, and a `formatted` timestamp (any other frontmatter keys from the original are preserved)
2. The model's formatted body
3. A verbatim `## Original Notes` section containing the untouched original text

The `formatted` frontmatter key marks a note as done, so a note is never formatted twice. Disabled by default — set `daily_format.enabled: true` to use it.

### Eligibility: the successor rule

- **A daily note is formatted once a later-dated daily note exists.** The single most recent daily note is always held back — it may still be in progress — and every older note is eligible. Calendar time is irrelevant: a note from months or years ago is picked up the moment any later-dated note appears. So your Friday note formats as soon as a Saturday (or any later) daily note exists, however long that takes.
- **No surprises from age:** there is no catch-up window and no start-date cutoff. The `formatted` frontmatter key marks a note as done, so already-formatted notes are skipped and never reprocessed.
- **Blacklist:** notes listed in `daily_format.blacklist` are never formatted, even when tagged, and never count as a successor. Entries match a filename stem (`2026-06-10`) or a vault-relative path (`drafts/letter`), with the `.md` suffix optional.

### Formatting any note on demand: the format tag

Type the `format_tag` marker (default `#!format`) anywhere in a note — daily or not — and the next run picks it up. The marker is stripped from the note as soon as it is queued, so the request survives even if Ollama is down at the time. Tagged notes skip the successor rule (the tag is the opt-in) and are formatted with the same structure, minus the `date` frontmatter key. Two exceptions: tagging an already-formatted note only consumes the marker (it is never double-wrapped), and tagging a daily note only consumes the marker too — dailies stay on the successor schedule. The model is also told these notes can hold mixed content (LLM prompts, logins, message drafts) and labels such sections with contextual headings like `## Draft: …` while preserving credentials, prompt text, code, URLs, and draft wording verbatim.

### Running it

```bash
obsidian-rag format-daily              # one formatting pass now
obsidian-rag format-daily --dry-run    # enqueue and report; never calls Ollama or rewrites notes
obsidian-rag format-daily --since 2026-03-19  # backfill from a date, including the most recent note
obsidian-rag format-daily --tags-only  # only pick up format-tagged notes (used by the poll agent)
```

`format-daily` exits non-zero if any note failed to format. Failed notes stay in the queue and are retried on the next run, up to `max_retries` attempts each, after which they are parked.

`--since` is the manual backfill escape hatch: it formats every daily note dated on or after the given date, **including the most recent one** (lifting the latest-note hold). The blacklist still applies. Use it to format a note that would otherwise sit as the newest note with no successor yet.

### Scheduling (macOS launchd)

```bash
obsidian-rag schedule install      # install (or reinstall) both LaunchAgents
obsidian-rag schedule status       # show launchd's view of both agents
obsidian-rag schedule uninstall    # remove both agents
```

`schedule install` writes two agents to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

- **`com.obsidian-rag.daily-format.plist`** runs `format-daily` every night at `schedule_hour:schedule_minute` (default 00:30). If the machine is asleep at the scheduled time, launchd fires the missed run when it wakes. Runs missed while powered off are not replayed at boot, but the catch-up window makes the next run pick up the backlog. Output goes to `~/.obsidian-rag/logs/daily-format.log`.
- **`com.obsidian-rag.format-tag-poll.plist`** runs `format-daily --tags-only` every `poll_minutes` (default 5) so format tags are picked up promptly instead of waiting for the nightly run. It is deliberately non-invasive: launchd marks it `ProcessType: Background` with `Nice 10` and low-priority IO, a poll that finds nothing exits without touching Ollama, and it runs once at login to catch tags dropped while the machine was off. Output goes to `~/.obsidian-rag/logs/tag-poll.log`.

### The persistent queue

Work is tracked in a JSON queue at `~/.obsidian-rag/format_queue.json`. The queue survives sleep, crashes, and failures: if Ollama is unreachable, everything stays queued for the next run, and one note's failure never aborts the rest of the run.

### Battery gate

A formatting run can spend minutes in the model, so on a laptop it defers when the battery is low. A run is deferred (everything left queued) only when the machine is **on battery power and below `min_battery_percent`** (default 20). On AC power — charging, no drain risk — a desktop with no battery, or whenever battery state can't be read, the run proceeds; the gate fails open and never blocks formatting indefinitely. There is no busy-waiting: a deferred run simply leaves the queue intact, and the next tag poll or nightly run picks it up once the battery recovers. Set `min_battery_percent: 0` to disable the gate.

### Model selection

When `daily_format.model` is set, it is validated against your pulled Ollama models (with an `ollama pull` hint if missing). When it is `null`, the first pulled model from this priority list is used:

1. `gemma4:26b-mlx`
2. `gemma4:12b-mlx`
3. `qwen3.5:9b`
4. `ministral-3:8b`
5. `llama3.2`

If none of those are pulled, the first pulled non-embedding model is used; if no chat model is available at all, the run fails with a suggestion to `ollama pull llama3.2`.

#### Model in use

This deployment auto-selects **`gemma4:26b-mlx`** — the `26b` Gemma 4 build in its **MLX-optimized**, `nvfp4`-quantized form for Apple Silicon (`ollama show` reports ~6.3B parameters and a 262k context window for this quant). It is `thinking`-capable and sized to run comfortably on-device here (an M3 Max / 36 GB). A smaller sibling, `gemma4:e4b-mlx` (the "effective-4B" edge variant), is also pulled but is **not** the active model — auto-select prefers `26b` because it ranks first in the priority list above.

**Do I need MLX in addition to Ollama?** No separate install. The model is pulled and served entirely **through Ollama** (`ollama pull gemma4:26b-mlx`) — Ollama's built-in MLX engine runs the `-mlx` build directly on Apple Silicon. You do **not** need to install Apple's MLX framework, `mlx-lm`, or any Python MLX package yourself. The only requirements are Ollama and an Apple Silicon Mac; on non-Apple-Silicon hardware, pick a non-MLX model from the priority list (e.g. `llama3.2`) instead.

> **Note:** `gemma4:26b-mlx` is a *thinking* model, and Ollama's MLX engine does not enforce structured-output (JSON schema) constraints. The formatter accounts for this internally — it disables the model's thinking step and parses JSON defensively — so no extra configuration is needed.

## CLI Reference

The package installs an `obsidian-rag` console script (equivalent to
`python -m obsidian_rag`). Bare invocation starts the MCP server:

```
obsidian-rag [OPTIONS]

  --config PATH       Path to config file (default: ~/.obsidian-rag/config.yaml)
  --vault-path PATH   Override the first vault's path
  --vault-name NAME   Override the first vault's name
  --ollama-url URL    Override the Ollama API URL
  --verbose           Log at INFO level (shows per-file indexing progress)
  --debug             Log at DEBUG level
  --version           Print the version and exit
```

Subcommands (see [Daily Note Formatting](#daily-note-formatting)):

```
obsidian-rag format-daily [OPTIONS]

  --config PATH       Path to config file (default: ~/.obsidian-rag/config.yaml)
  --dry-run           Enqueue and report, but do not call Ollama or rewrite notes
  --since YYYY-MM-DD  Backfill from this date, including the most recent note
  --tags-only         Only pick up format-tagged notes (used by the poll agent)

obsidian-rag schedule install   [--config PATH]   Install (or reinstall) both LaunchAgents
obsidian-rag schedule uninstall [--config PATH]   Remove both LaunchAgents
obsidian-rag schedule status    [--config PATH]   Show both agents' launchd status
```

`format-daily` exits with status 1 when any note failed to format. All logs
and command output go to stderr; stdout is reserved for the MCP stdio protocol.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Ollama is not reachable"**
Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`. By default the server listens on `http://localhost:11434`.

**"Embedding model not found"**
Pull the required model: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`. The model name must match `embedding.model` in your config.

**"Rerank model not found"**
Either pull the model (`ollama pull llama3.2`) or disable reranking in your config:
```yaml
rerank:
  enabled: false
```

**No search results returned**
- Lower `retrieval.similarity_threshold` (e.g., `0.5`) to allow less similar matches through.
- Verify the vault path in your config is correct and the directory contains `.md` files.
- Check that `vault_stats` reports a non-zero chunk count — if zero, the index build may have failed.

**`faiss-cpu` install fails on macOS 13 (Ventura)**
The ARM64 pip wheel for `faiss-cpu` requires macOS 14+. On macOS 13 with Apple Silicon, install via conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu
```

**Server not appearing in Claude Desktop**
- Verify the `claude_desktop_config.json` JSON is valid (no trailing commas).
- Check that `python -m obsidian_rag` works from your terminal with the same Python that Claude Desktop will use.
- Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config file.

**File changes not being picked up**
File watching is enabled by default (`indexing.watch_enabled: true`). If changes aren't reflected, use the `reindex` tool to force a rebuild, or restart the server.
